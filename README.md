# to do counter

This is project or part two of my to do series.

In the building of a life repetition is natural and sometimes wished for.
I'd like to know how often when, since the last time.

Construction:

- add activities
- click a button when done
- keep date
	- added
	- all done

- display time since last done

TODO:
- get int out of time diff
- make color gradient depending on ^
- get form inline



Extra:
- get to chose rate + and then make urgency based on rate
	chart of DIS ^
		- in page!!! - little lines in div of activity indicating when happened in the last year or something.


Why?
because some things are pretty neat
